        <p class="larger">Redhawk Ventures is committed to connecting Miami University to the complex and diverse world
            of the
            entrepreneurial ecosystem, and venture capital. The purpose of this blog is to provide an educational
            resource for students at Miami to learn about how their fields of study connect to startups.</p>
        <p class="larger">There is a common misconception that venture capital is a strictly financial field, but this
            is not the case. Venture as a field is focused on <b>humans</b> first and finances second. Startups come
            from all
            fields of study, and therefore so do the individuals in venture capital that strive to learn about and
            support these startups.</p>
