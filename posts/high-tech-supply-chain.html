        <h1>High Tech Supply Chain in the Startup Ecosystem</h1>
        <p>When small optimizations to a supply chain can result in massive values adds for a company, it’s not a
            surprise that tech startups are emerging with business models centered around improving operational
            efficiency. We’ve seen robotics companies developing drones and autonomous delivery bots to solve the last
            mile problem, but these solutions are still far from mainstream. Supply chains are also becoming more
            optimized through Software as a Service technologies<a href="#" style="display: none">(what is B2B
                SaaS?)</a>, like <a href="https://tealbook.com/">Tealbook</a>,
            which provides a
            tool to manage a network of suppliers for more efficient procurement. Who are these startups, and how do
            they make the jump from prototype to mainstream supply chain tech?</p>
        <h2>Starship Technologies and the Last Mile Problem</h2>

        <p>Starship Technologies is a tech company founded in 2014 that is developing small self-driving vehicles to
            assist in the final phases of delivery. Starship Technologies hopes to solve the last mile problem by using
            these autonomous robots to deliver packages, or food, directly to the doorstep of the consumers. These
            robots are designed to handle deliveries within a 2-3 mile radius, for a delivery cost of under <a
                href="https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/robotic-company/directory/listings/starship-technologies/">$1.00
                per
                delivery.</a>
        </p>
        <p>According to a study, the last mile problem, or the final link in the supply chain, accounts for <a
                href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1043253/share-of-total-supply-chain-costs-by-type-worldwide/">
                41% of the
                total supply chain cost.</a> In terms of dollars per delivery, the last mile costs an <a
                href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/973182/last-mile-delivery-average-cost/">average
                of $10.10.</a>
            With
            these significantly lower costs, Starship Technologies could bring revolutionary optimizations to the last
            mile of the supply chain, improving profit margins for any company that delivers directly to consumers.
        </p>
        <p>The total size of the last mile delivery market was estimated at $30.2B in 2018, and with their robotics,
            Starship Technologies is looking to carve out a piece of that market for themselves. Venture investors see
            the promise in using technology to solve the last mile problem and have invested $82.2M in Starship
            Technologies as of 2019. The company is currently valued at $200M.
